Algorithms:
1. Regular polynomial multiplication O(n^2) alg:
A and B are polynomials of degree n. 
We multiply all coefficients of B with one coefficient of A at a time,
and make the sum of the coefficients of the same degree.

2. Karatsuba's alg O(n^log3):
Karatsuba's algorithms uses the Divide and Conquer approach, 
it is a fast multiplication algorithms. It uses 3 multiplications of smaller numbers,
each with haslf as many digits as x or y, additions and coeff shifts.
